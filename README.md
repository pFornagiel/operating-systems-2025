# Operating Systems Labs ðŸ’»
## Computer Science | AGH 2025

## Project Description

This repository contains solutions and implementations for laboratory exercises from the Operating Systems course at AGH University of Cracow. The labs focus on fundamental concepts such as process management, inter-process communication, synchronization, and system programming in C.

Each lab is organized in its own directory and includes source code, Makefiles, and documentation.

| Lab 8      | POSIX threads and synchronization | [lab8](lab8/) |
| Lab 9      | Semaphores and shared memory | [lab9](lab9/) |
| Lab 10     | Process management and IPC | [lab10](lab10/) |
| Lab 11     | Client-server communication, shared headers | [lab11](lab11/) |
| Lab 12     | Advanced IPC, client-server, shared headers | [lab12](lab12/) |


## Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Make
- Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) recommended

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/os-labs-agh-2025.git
cd os-labs-agh-2025
```
### 2. Build a Lab

Navigate to the desired lab directory and run `make`:
```bash
cd labX
make
```
This will compile the source files and generate the executables in the same directory.

### 3. Run the Programs

After building, run the executables as described in each lab's README or source code comments. For example:
```bash
./main
```
Refer to each lab's directory for specific usage instructions.
